# NOT FINISHED! Max Nordström - Work Sample for 040

I've built this form using a html5 boilerplate and bootstrap.

The user input is saved to a database that can be found in the database folder.
The different courses (found in the endpoints folder) are structured as different tables in the database, named 'course' followed by the number that represents the course ID. The user input of each participant signing up for a course will be added to the corresponding table.

##Local environment

Set up the form locally using MAMP (or stack of your choice) and put the project folder in your root directory (in my case it's **/htdocs**). Checkout the **.env** file so that it corresponds to your local environemnt.

## What you’ll be doing
You will be creating an application form for a fictitious school. This form will let our school accept applications from companies that want to attend their courses.

Each course is available at different dates. All applications must be saved in a database and contains the following:

- Course ID
- Course date
- Company name
- Company phone number
- Company e-mail
- 1 or more participants. Each participant consists of the following: name, phone number and e-mail

## Expectations
We expect you to create this signup flow using PHP and MySQL on the backend and HTML, CSS and JS on the frontend. You are free to use any frameworks and preprocessors you wish, as well as define a suitable database structure.

The finished work sample should have a readme describing how to get the application up and running.

We expect you to host the code as a repository on Github under your own profile.

## Resources
Design is available in the design folder of this repository. The courses are available as json in the endpoints folder.

The font is Source Sans Pro: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro

## If you have time
The following items are not required but if you have the time feel free to implement them. We will review these extras in the same way we review the base work sample.

- **UI/UX:** Consider different ways to polish the form using interactions, animations and anything else you feel would enrich the user experience.
- **Add views:** Build views (index, individual item) for our schools’s administrators to let them browse the course applications from an interface.
- **Minimize spam:** Consider ways to minimize the number of spam submissions in the form.

## Have fun!
This test is not about pointing fingers or say you did something wrong. We want to see how you think and how you implement a common task into code.
